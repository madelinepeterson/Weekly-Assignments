Assignment follows downloading a reference script and raw seq data, doing a QC/QA analysis, trimming and removing adaptors form the raw seq data.

Using efetch to download the seq data for Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z2901 from NCBI. Note the importance of format, we want to align sequences, so fasta is a better format than a gb file.
1) efetch -db=sequences -id=CP000141.1 -format=fasta > Z2901.fasta

Using gdown we can download data from google drive files.The code in the middle is switched out to download different files, and the ending names the file in your directory. I saved the file type as fastq and no .gz because we were told it was not a zippped file.

Assignment follows downloading a reference script and raw seq data, doing a QC/QA analysis, trimming and removing adaptors form the raw seq data.

Note: In the scratch file > weekly_assignment_4
Note: Don't know how to access files through icons, so redownloaded files into the normal directory

Using efetch to download the reference seq data for Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z2901 from NCBI. Note the importance of format, we want to align sequences, so fasta is a better format than a gb file.
1) efetch -db=sequences -id=CP000141.1 -format=fasta > Z2901.fasta

Using gdown we can download the raw read data (forward and reverse) from google drive files. The code in the middle is switched out to download different files, and the ending names the file in your directory. I saved the file type as fastq and no .gz because we were told it was not a zippped file.

R1
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWWO5wVRRThLBXXEZjyWZHIb9udVcnCS/edit C_ferri_R1.fastq
R2
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZFvpSIctuBihkOlQX9vhrkxng3cRmvK/edit C_ferri_R2.fastq

The command fastqc goes through and measures the quality of ALL of the reads, the two ref and the raw.

fastqc C_ferri_R1.fastq
fastqc C_ferri_R2.fastq

NOTE: In order to view the results of the FastQC file you need to open the newly created .html of that data. Clicking and opening this from the computer directory will show the output.

(this one should already be trimmed because it's the ref seq?)
fastqc Z2901.fasta

From here, the fastqc report should tell you about adapter contamination, and in that case how to remove and trim them. Personal computer unable to access FastQC  display. attempting gdown of new files ending in .gz, but did nothing because the files were not zipped.

**ANSWERS:
*Were these reads of high quality?
Yes, both of the reads showed high quality status in all of the FastQC report categories. There was an error shown in the "overrrepresented Sequence" section in both, but this was due to primer sequences, which we can trim.
*Was trimming required?
Yes, the primers need to be removed from the sequences. 

Note: Four sequences were shown to appear in high counts. The top two had very similar sequences, so I copied the sequence they both shared up until they began to diverge. I didn't do anything with the other sequences due to their much smaller counts compared to the top two (GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATT) this was only for primer 2, the adapter sequence for primer 1 showed the top adapter contamination to be (GATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCG).

Note: It appears that the second top contamination hit was is only a base or a few bases different than the top hit-- potentially misreads or altered primers? R1 has primer 2 R2 has primer 1

Code to trim the adaptors.

cutadapt -q 20,20 -a GATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCG -A GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATT -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C_ferri_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p C_ferri_R2.cutadapt.fastq C_ferri_R1.fastq C_ferri_R2.fastq

**ANSWERS
*How many reads contained adaptors for each file?
 Read 1 with adapter:                  13,544 (1.4%)
 Read 2 with adapter:                  17,204 (1.7%)

Need to then index the reference to be able to use it for alignment.
bowtie2-build Z2901.fasta Z2901_indexed

Then the indexed reference can be used to help align the raw reads. 
bowtie2 -x Z2901_indexed -1 C_ferri_R1.cutadapt.fastq -2 C_ferri_R2.cutadapt.fastq -S mapped_C_ferri.sam

**ANSWERS
What percentage of the reads mapped to the reference genome?
What percentage of reads did not map to the reference genome?

Assignment follows downloading a reference script and raw seq data, doing a QC/QA analysis, trimming and removing adaptors form the raw seq data.

Note: In the scratch file > weekly_assignment_4

Using efetch to download the seq data for Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z2901 from NCBI. Note the importance of format, we want to align sequences, so fasta is a better format than a gb file.
1) efetch -db=sequences -id=CP000141.1 -format=fasta > Z2901.fasta

Using gdown we can download the reference data (forward and reverse) from google drive files. The code in the middle is switched out to download different files, and the ending names the file in your directory. I saved the file type as fastq and no .gz because we were told it was not a zippped file.

R2
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZFvpSIctuBihkOlQX9vhrkxng3cRmvK/edit C_ferri_R2.fastq

The command fastqc goes through and measures the quality of ALL of the reads, the two ref and the raw.

fastqc C_ferri_R1.fastq
fastqc C_ferri_R2.fastq
fastqc Z2901.fasta

From here, the fastqc report should tell you about adapter contamination, and in that case how to remove and trim them. Personal computer unable to access FastQC  display. attempting gdown of new files ending in .gz, but did nothing because the files were not zipped.

Code to trim the adaptors. Are the adaptors the same?

This assignment includes the initial steps in downloading, trimming, and assembling raw data

Dowloading data:
R1
https://drive.google.com/a/mtu.edu/file/d/1nu6aYpmOFep5huUw1gyfcXjo-fpAqg0L/view?usp=sharing
  gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nu6aYpmOFep5huUw1gyfcXjo-fpAqg0L/edit D23_R1.fastq.gz
R2
https://drive.google.com/a/mtu.edu/file/d/1RoVAcT0IXV2DT9l5qWoI2NjPuJltpWDf/view?usp=sharing
  gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RoVAcT0IXV2DT9l5qWoI2NjPuJltpWDf/edit D23_R2.fastq.gz

Then we'll need to unzip the files.
  gunzip D23_R1.fastq.gz
  gunzip D23_R2.fastq.gz
And transforming these files into readable .fastq files.

Now that we have the .fatsq files, we can assess the quality of the data.
  fastqc D23_R1.fastq
  fastqc D23_R2.fastq
Which we can then open in by clicking on the html files in our desktop files using WinSCP, showing us the quality report.
The report shows there are quality issues in both of the reads towards the end of the sequences.

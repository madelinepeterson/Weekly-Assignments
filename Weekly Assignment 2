Trying to code to:
-fetch metadata
-sort by gene to show how many genes for that sequence (can count lines beginning with >)
-sort and pull "photosystem subunits" through sort
-pull the sequence for the ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit protein in its own fasta folder


**attempts at finding the protein data
efetch -db=sequences -id= NC_008535.1 -format=gb | elink -db=protein | xtract -pattern Feature -sep"\n" -element= CDS
*this code did not work

esearch -db=sequences -query= "NC_008535.1" -sort=gene
*this code says i'm missing an argument

esearch -db=gene -query= "NC_008535.1" -sort=Name
*fails and says i need an argument after -query

esearch -db=gene -query="NC_008535."
*got stuck and didn't give me output

esearch -db=sequences -query="NC_008535.1" -sort="Taxonomy ID"
*fails and says invalid -db name

efetch -db=sequences -id="NC_008535.1" -format=gb  -sort="Taxonomy ID"
*fails and says unknown sort option

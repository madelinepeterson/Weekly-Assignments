Trying to code to:
-fetch metadata
-sort by gene to show how many genes for that sequence
-sort and pull photosystem subunits
-pull the sequence for the ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit protein in its own folder

efetch -db=sequences -id= NC_008535.1 -format=gb | elink -db=protein | xtract -pattern Feature -sep"\n" -element= CDS
*this code did not work

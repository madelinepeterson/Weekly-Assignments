**This assignment is a download of the identified proteins from an unknown organism. Using reference sequences in BLAST, this code will identify heat shock proteins and related proteins.

Downloading the list of identified protein sequences from the organism:
  wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/Unk_therm.faa

Downloading a list of reference proteins in order to then create a database specifically for the purpose of identifying specific proteins.
